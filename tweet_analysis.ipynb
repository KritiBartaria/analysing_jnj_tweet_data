    "-  Sentiment analysis\n",
    "  -  Sentiment analysis utilizes text analysis to systematically identify affective states of languages. The unique context of our dataset (i.e., including both pre- and post- of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine pause in the US) would allow the user to explore the differences in attitudes toward the vaccine between those two distinct periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Social Network Analysis\n",
    "  - Social Network Analysis is a technique to study social structures in terms of \"actors\" in the network and the \"links\" between the actors. In the context of our dataset, an actor could be considered as the users who posted the tweets, and the link between the actors could be conceptualized in a number of ways. For example, a link could be operationalized as a retweet. If actor B retweet a tweet from actor A, then there would be a link between the two. Users who are interested in how vaccine information is spread before/after the J&J vaccine pause may consider pursuing social network analysis.    \n",

    "## CHALLENGES: EXPERIENCED AND UPCOMING\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, we set out to study tweets that spread misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines and the potential societal implications this can have. We wanted to identify characteristics of tweets that were reaching large audiences and causing hesitation and uncertainty surrounding the vaccine. We also wanted to identify any factors that could play into vaccine hesitancy for example maybe a specific age group is more likely to spread misinformation than others. Or perhaps a broadcasted news event sparked an influx of anti-vaccine related posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the complexity of our target data, we decided to shift our focus. It is extremely difficult to parse text with all the possible language nuances that could interfere such as typos and slang. The most difficult hiderence to detect is probably sarcasm, which is a very common dialect on the Twitter platform. Many people tweeting about vaccine hesitancy are doing so as a joke for their audiences. These obstructions could greatly impact the validity of our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we narrowed our focus to only look at data focused on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and, specifically, only during the two weeks leading up to the temporary pause of distribution of this version of the vaccine. Secondly, our data aquisition was based on buzzwords and hashtags users feature in their tweets about Covid-19 and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Location data is self-identfied and optional for Twitter users. This makes it hard to accurately identify where users are located and limit the dataset to our target base of US residents to understand unique cultural / social implications. \n",
    "*   Identifying buzzwords and hashtags to track conversations about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was a challenge. The list we came up with is not exhaustive and could be honed in the future.\n",
    "*   Originally, we had some difficulties pulling a large number of tweets on but, through trial and error, finetuned the code to retrieve around 10,000 tweets.\n",
